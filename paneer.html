        <p> <b>Ingredients :</b>
            
            Paneer,Peas,Cashews, black pepper, onions, garlic-ginger paste, mixed vegetables,coriander powder, garam masala,turmeric powder, salt ,chilli powder, green chillies</p><br> 
        
        <b><p class="Recipes-Heading">Follow below steps to make matter paneer</p></b><br> 
        <p><b>Step1: </b>In a medium bowl, measure out 8 ounces of canned tomatoes and place in the fridge. Save any extra canned liquid for another use. If using store-bought paneer, soak following the recipe note instructions while you prepare the tomato onion puree.</p><br> 

        <p><b>Step 2:</b>.In a medium Dutch oven or a large skillet, over medium-low heat, add 1 tablespoon oil, ginger, and garlic. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the ginger and garlic are aromatic and lightly golden brown, about 2 minutes.

            Increase heat to medium, then add the onions, stirring occasionally, until they are soft and golden brown, 6 to 7 minutes. The brown caramelization on the onions adds flavor here, so donâ€™t be afraid to increase the heat if necessary.</p><br> 

        <p><b>Step 3: </b>Turn the heat off and transfer the onion mixture to a blender carafe. Remove the tomatoes from the fridge and add them into the blender.

Check that the mixture's temperature is no warmer than lukewarm (otherwise, you will need to let it cool to room temperature for about an additional 5 minutes before blending).

Blend on high for about 1 minute until the mixture is a thick, homogeneous puree. Set aside.
        </p><br> 

        <p><b>Step 4:</b>Make the sauce:
            Wipe the Dutch oven or skillet clean using a clean kitchen towel or paper towels. Heat to medium and add the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil, cardamom, and cloves.
            
            Once they begin to sizzle, stir in the pureed sauce, garam masala, chili powder, coriander, cumin, and salt. Cook, until the sauce thickens and begins to pull away from the sides of the pan, about 5 minutes.
            
            Add 1 cup of water and maple syrup and stir to combine. Bring the mixture to a boil and let simmer, uncovered, on medium heat for an additional 5 minutes. The sauce should not appear watery and have a similar thickness to marinara sauce.</p><br>
            
            <p><b>Step 5</b>Add the peas and cook, until just warmed through, about 1 minute. Stir in the cream and paneer. Cook on low heat for 1 minute until the sauce resembles a deep orange color and the peas and paneer are distributed throughout the liquid.</p><br>

                <p><b>Step 6:</b>Taste and season the sauce with additional salt as needed. Remove the whole cardamom and cloves if desired. Crush the dried fenugreek leaves with your hands as you sprinkle them into the pan.

                    Garnish with cilantro. Serve hot with roti, naan, and/or rice.</p><br>
